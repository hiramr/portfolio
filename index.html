					<p>On December 1, 1975, history was made – history on a college campus, which would transcend other colleges/universities throughout the United States; history which would have a positive impact on the Latino community and our nation; history which would forever change the Greek system, more specifically, the entity known as a fraternity. On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.</p>
					<p>In 1975, there were no Latino fraternities in existence in the United States. The Greek-letter organizations of the time primarily catered to Anglo and African-American students and graduates. Lambda’s founders, as men of vision, realized there was a need to unite the Latino students, develop their leadership skills, impart upon them the value of an education, and instill in them a commitment to their community and culture. The traditional student club would not suffice to accomplish such lofty goals. Hence, Latino unity and brotherhood would be achieved through a long recognized institution – the fraternity. This newest addition to the Greek system would be the first in the nation, by identity and by name: Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Incorporated.</p>
					<p>The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.</p> 	
					<p>At the undergraduate level, our brothers are active within the Fraternity and in other student organizations. Our brothers perform community service, promote our culture by sponsoring events which highlight and celebrate our heritage, participate in educational workshops, and enjoy many social programs. As a result of their active participation in every aspect of college life, our undergraduates are developing their organizational, communication, and leadership skills, all while pursuing the coveted diploma. Our younger Lambdas are receiving the training and competence to serve as the future leaders of our brotherhood, community, and nation. </p>
					<p>At the professional level, among our ranks you will find attorneys, doctors, and engineers. Our brothers are shaping young minds as educators and as dedicated fathers. The men in brown and white are defending this country at home and abroad in the area of law enforcement and in the armed forces. We are strengthening our country’s economy as entrepreneurs. Our brothers are teaching leadership as coaches, mentors, and community activists. The Lambdas are affecting policy and change as elected officials serving on City Councils, Boards of Education, U.S. House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate. In short, Lambdas are contributing and excelling in every facet of human endeavor.</p> 
					<p>Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation. </p>
					<p>Our illustrious history is not only our past but our guiding light to the future. As the first, we overcame many obstacles. Not having much guidance in our formative stages, we persevered and became stronger. Lambda is the product of vision, strength, and unity. Our history serves as a legacy and testament to our accomplishments and greatness.</p>	
					<p>Lambda Theta Phi … <br>Academic Excellence – Brotherhood – Leadership – Latino Unity - Service.</p>

					<p>2014 was also a notable year as it marked the signing of a historic agreement between Lambda Theta Phi and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI).  On July 30, 2014, President José Grajales met with leaders of CHCI to sign a memorandum of understanding between the two organizations for a philanthropic and service-oriented partnership to help develop Latin@ students nationwide.  Lambda Theta Phi has committed to fundraising for CHCI’s R2L NextGen Program as its national philanthropy, as well as supporting CHCI’s Ready 2 Lead college readiness programs throughout the country with alumni and undergraduate mentors.</p>

				<div class="paragraph">
					<p>The strength of Lambda Theta Phi can be found in its small, family-like chapters.  Whether it’s an undergraduate chapter at a college or university, or one of our many alumni chapters in metropolitan areas throughout the country, Brothers find a sense of family in their chapter.  Every Lambda Man begins at a chapter or associate chapter, and we encourage you to learn more about our over 150 undergraduate and alumni entities.
						<br><br>Most Lambdas begin their experience as a brother at an undergraduate chapter or associate chapter.  An associate chapter is a newly established entity of the Fraternity that has not yet earned a charter, or chapter status.  Once an associate chapter has successfully satisfied the requirements for a charter, it becomes a full chapter with a Greek-letter designation (e.g. Alpha, Beta, etc.).  Chapters and associate chapters are a central part of the Lambda experience, facilitating personal and leadership development, developing a commitment to community service and philanthropy, and actively engaging in social issues affecting Latino communities.  All undergraduate entities are affiliated with a four-year college or university.</p>
