				<p class = "paragraph">Lambda Theta Phi was founded by 14 Latino students at Kean College as a vehicle by which they would foster Latino unity and address inequities in the way Latinos were being treated on campus. The fraternity’s founding fathers received guidance and assistance from a faculty member, Cayetano Socarras, and a administrator, Jose Quiles who would become the organizations “fraternal fathers.” <br> <br>Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity Inc. Founded December 1, 1975</p>

					<p class = "description">Fraternal Father Dr. Cayetano J. Socarrás provided most of the assistance in developing a truly “Latino” identity for the Fraternity. Knowledgeable in the art of heraldry (crest design), Fraternal Father Socarrás guided the brothers in designing the original shield in 1976. As Fraternal Father Socarrás focused on the symbolic aspects of the brotherhood, Fraternal Father José Quiles assisted with the organizational components, including the structure and administration of the Fraternity.  Dr. Socarrás passed away in 1994, may he rest in power.</p>

Fraternal Father Quiles has often described his role in the Fraternity as a “technical resource” and continues to be a valuable asset to the brotherhood.</p>

They are known as the only fall line in the chapter history since 1997.

				<p class = "description">From September to November of 1975, a group of students, from which would eventually emerge the Founding Fathers of Lambda Theta Phi, met to find the solution to uniting the different Latino groups on campus.

					These meetings were initiated by Founding Father García, who had already spearheaded a important breakthrough for Latino students by becoming the first Latino elected to the Kean College student government. The major topics of discussion at these meetings were the need to become politically conscious and active as Latino students and the unification of all Latinos, since at the time “Latin Unity” was not common among students of different Latino national origins.
					
					At a meeting on November 11, 1975, Founding Father García proposed the idea of founding a fraternity. Having become familiar with the workings of the college administration and student government he recognized that a fraternity could promote Latin unity through brotherhood. He also understood that fraternities were an organizational structure that college administrators acknowledged and one with which they were accustomed. Lambda Theta Phi was founded as a Latin Fraternity, which was specifically stated in its constitution, making it the first “Latino” fraternity in the United States.</p>
